# CORE Language Test Files

A collection of files to test an interpreter for the CORE toy programming
language. Not official; please use according to your own best judgement.


## How to run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zqianem/corelang-test-files.git
cd corelang-test-files

./run_tests.sh [command_to_run_your_interpreter]
```

You may need to modify this slightly depending on your system.

### Examples

```sh
./run_tests.sh core
./run_tests.sh "java CoreInterpreter"
./run_tests.sh "python ../corelang/interpreter.py"
```

Note the quotes if the command to run your interpreter involves calling another
program (such as `java`, `python`, etc.). You may want to consider using a
dedicated script file to encapsulate the call to the other program.


## Test and naming conventions

### Directories

Used to group related tests, name with all-lowercase words separated by hyphens
if necessary.

### Valid tests

Valid tests are those that are expected to run in the interpreter without error
and produce the output specified in the project guidelines.

The name of a valid test is a all-lowercase single word, optionally followed by
a number, and cannot contain `bad` as a substring. The test itself consists of
three files with its name and the suffixes `.code`, `.data`, and `.expected`,
respectively.

###  Invalid tests

Invalid tests are those tests that have code containing lexical, syntactical, or
semantic errors, which should prematurely stop interpreter output with a line
containing `ERROR: {some_description}`.

The name of an invalid test is either `badlex`, `badsyn`, or `badsem`,
corresponding to the type of error it is expected to produce (type of error not
checked for the test runner script), optionally followed by a number. The test
itself consists of two files with its name and the suffixes `.code` and `.data`.

### General

If a test warrants additional explanation that may not be obvious from its name
or code, a file named `{test_name}.remarks` can be included. This file will not
be read by the test runner script, so it can contain anything (but be
reasonable).

If the data file for a test is empty, it can be omitted. The interpreter will
still be run with the `empty.data` file, however.
